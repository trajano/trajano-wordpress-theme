Trajano WordPress Theme
=======================

This theme is targeted for personal text content blogs with a single author.

Objectives
----------
* Magazine style layout
* [Responsive web design][rwd]
* No animations that are not triggered by a user action (e.g. resize or mouse click).
* Make use of infinite scroll to handle large amounts of posts

This theme does not use minified versions of the code, it expects the WordPress site to use [W3 Total Cache][w3tc]to
reduce the load.  This was done to make it easier to extend and debug problems on the theme,
